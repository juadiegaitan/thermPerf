* thermPerf: model fitting for thermal performance curves

*Disclaimer:* this is a collection of functions that we use in our research
group to fit curves to bacterial growth and yield data. The defaults in these
functions are tuned for curve fitting using this data, and might be
inappropriate for other temperature ranges/traits values/curve shapes!

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(devtools)
install_github("mdjbru-R-packages/thermPef")
#+END_SRC

** Quick example

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(thermPerf)

# Some thermal performance data
temp = c(17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 33, 
         17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 33)
growth = c(0.3, 0.4, 0.68, 0.8, 0.82, 0.3, 
           0.4, 0.45, 0.58, 0.75, 0.85, 0.6)

# Plot the raw data
plot(temp, growth, pch = 21, bg = "grey", las = 1)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC R
# Fit the default models and plot the results
fits = fitModels(getModelLibrary(), temp, growth)
plot(fits)

# Get the AIC weights and visualize them
weights = calculateAIC(fits)
plot(weights)

# Interpolate trait value for some temperature
interpolateAtTemp(fits, 26)
